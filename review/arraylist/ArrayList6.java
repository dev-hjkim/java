/**
 * Resizable-array implementation of the <tt>List</tt> interface.  Implements
 * all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including
 * <tt>null</tt>.  In addition to implementing the <tt>List</tt> interface,
 * this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is
 * used internally to store the list.  (This class is roughly equivalent to
 * <tt>Vector</tt>, except that it is unsynchronized.)
 *
 * <p>The <tt>size</tt>, <tt>isEmpty</tt>, <tt>get</tt>, <tt>set</tt>,
 * <tt>iterator</tt>, and <tt>listIterator</tt> operations run in constant
 * time.  The <tt>add</tt> operation runs in <i>amortized constant time</i>,
 * that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.  All of the other operations
 * run in linear time (roughly speaking).  The constant factor is low compared
 * to that for the <tt>LinkedList</tt> implementation.
 *
 * <p>Each <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance has a <i>capacity</i>.  The capacity is
 * the size of the array used to store the elements in the list.  It is always
 * at least as large as the list size.  As elements are added to an ArrayList,
 * its capacity grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 * specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized
 * time cost.
 *
 * <p>An application can increase the capacity of an <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance
 * before adding a large number of elements using the <tt>ensureCapacity</tt>
 * operation.  This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access an <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance concurrently,
 * and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it
 * <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is
 * any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements, or explicitly
 * resizes the backing array; merely setting the value of an element is not
 * a structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list.
